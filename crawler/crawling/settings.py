----------------------------------------
The below parameters configure how spiders throttle themselves across the cluster
All throttling is based on the TLD of the page you are requesting, plus any of the
following parameters:

Type: You have different spider types and want to limit how often a given type of
spider hits a domain

IP: Your crawlers are spread across different IP's, and you want each IP crawler clump
to throttle themselves for a given domain

Combinations for any given Top Level Domain:
None - all spider types and all crawler ips throttle themselves from one tld queue
Type only - all spiders throttle themselves based off of their own type-based tld queue,
    regardless of crawler ip address
IP only - all spiders throttle themselves based off of their public ip address, regardless
    of spider type
Type and IP - every spider's throttle queue is determined by the spider type AND the
    ip address, allowing the most fined grained control over the throttling mechanism
