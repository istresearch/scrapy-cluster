Scrapy Cluster Utilities
************************

Overview
--------

The ``scutils`` package is a collection of utilities that are used by the Scrapy Cluster project.  These utilities are agnostic enough that they can be used by any application.

Requirements
------------

- Unix based machine (Linux or OS X)
- Python 2.7.x

Installation
------------

Inside a virtualenv, run ``pip install -U scutils``.  This will install the latest version of the Scrapy Cluster Utilities.  If you are running a Scrapy Cluster, ``scutils`` is included inside of the **requirements.txt** so there is no need to install it separately.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation for the ``scutils`` package will be included as part of the Scrapy Cluster 1.1 release.  Basic descriptions are below.
